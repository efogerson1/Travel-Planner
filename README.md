# group-proj-1
Working in a collab
// Order of operation:
// 1. Miranda is making calls to APIs, pulling values
// 2. Eric is handling call output, putting pulled information into local storage for future use
// 3. Jason printing local storage to page, weather results & currecy comparisons
// 4. Nicole is creating javascript logic to conditionally show cards, either all conditions are good for travel, OR one condition is not favorable, 'think about it'
//         -Nicole will be styling HTML with CSS framework other than Bootstrap (make sure page is responsive)

// Good luck everyone! Go team!
